The evaluation measures provided here are: Jaccard Index, Adjusted Rand Index, Normalised 
Mutual Information and Classification Accuracy. All of these assume an external label set.
The code is written in MATLAB as there is a notable lack of external measures for
cluster validation.  There are function for internal validation, e.g., `evalclusters`
